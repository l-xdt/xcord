# XCord

A clone of the Discord chat websit. This is a back-up for my hard-disk just in-case it becomes corrupt - and a point of  comparison for you.

The assets can be found [here](https://github.com/JawherBalti/discord-clone)

## Run Locally

Clone the project and Run it on XAMPP.

(**PS:** I would recommend, an alternative domain from localhost, to add some more reality to the effect.)

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/l-xdt/xcor
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd xcord
```

Install XAMPP (via Chocalatey, if you dont have it.)

```bash
  chocalatey install xampp
```

Start the server

```bash
  [Directory]/[ServerName]/apache-start.bat
```

**PS:** If you trust your web skills, here is a manual on how to self- host a domain: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQGAJVtRCs) (by Soeng Souy)

## FAQ

**Now, my fav, FAQ!**

#### Can I modify this is anyway to fit my needs.

Exactly! That is what we made this repository for. This for you to experiment with.

#### Can I host this, if I can how?

You can, with my real favourite, XAMPP! I have explained it a thousand times, from all those read-mes. But I will explain again.

It works by using the IP that works with every Windows, Linux (and some select macOS) computers:
127.0.0.1 used to host your little websites.
